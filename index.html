          <p>git vc, but hosted on a public site featuring a ton of social features to help create some of the best projects on the internet.</p>
          <p>Unless specifically asked not to, All of my code projects are public facing.</p>
          <p>but you can host private repos on GitHub as well and still take advantage of all the features of GitHub.</p>
          <p>A key feature of GitHub is the ability for someone to copy your repo and make it their own, we call this forking</p>

          <p>Do you have code standards? Most people do. Imagine being able to check to make sure that your developers are abiding by those standards, With line-by-line details of code changes, you have that capability in GitHub. Everyone with permissions has the ability to look at code before its pulled into the main repo and say "yes, your code looks great, lets get it on the server" or "actually, I see that you didnt code this piece to out set standard, so I'll deny this request for now, please look at it again and re-submit once its standardized. I can help you out of you need.</p>

          <p>Project dashboard called "Pulse" will give you an overview of the repository as a whole, we'll talk about Issues and Pulse later.</p>
