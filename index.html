            <p>Welcome to the wonderful world of GitHub ...for cats</p>
            <p>I'm Eric Steinborn and I'll be your guide today.</p>
            <p>You just watched the Official GitHub Music video, and since you're attending gitHub for cats, you also watched the most viewed cat video on the internet, Surprised Kitty.</p>
            <p>My Goal today is for you to leave with a firm understanding of What GitHub is, how to use it.</p>
            <p>most importantly though, why you should use it to Unlock your teams true potential</p>
            <p>Let's begin with the most important question of all</p>
          </aside>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Why call it "GitHub for Cats?"</h2>
        <p>GitHub's mascot is a cross between an Octopus and a Cat</p>
        <p><img class=" no-border no-shadow" style="padding-right:10px" src="img/original.png" height="300px" alt="octocat"><img class="fragment no-border no-shadow" style="padding-right:10px" height="300px" src="img/jean-luc-picat.png" alt="octocat"><img class="fragment no-border no-shadow" style="padding-right:10px" height="300px" src="img/ironcat.png" alt="octocat"></p>
        <p><a href="http://octodex.github.com/">View the Octodex</a></p>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>Their mascot is a cross between a cat and an octopus, an octocat</p>
          <p>Their employees have a lot of fun creating different renditions of their beloved mascot</p>
          <p>Renditions such as the jean luc picat for my fellow trekkies out there</p>
          <p>or how about the Iron cat, for any iron man fans out there!</p>
          <p>I wanted to create a title that meant that GitHub was easy to use, So my subtitle is GitHub is so easy your Cat could use it! and after today hopefully you'll agree.</p>
          <p>so now that ive answered the most important question of the day, I'll answer the second most important question.</p>

        <h2>So What is GitHub Anyway?</h2>
        <p>Version control hosting for projects</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>Version control for your projects, But that would be selling it short, as it's much more than just source control</p>
          <p>It's Version Control with a robust set of collaborative and project management tools</p>
          <p>there are so many people on GitHub that it's becoming the new standard in the IT project landscape</p>

          <li>16.4 million hosted projects</li>
          <li>Running a 99.96% uptime</li>
        </ul>
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>gitHub is home to millions of developers hosting over 10 million projects, featuring an uptime just won't quit</p>
          <p>Many job applications list GitHub knowledge as a requirement.</p>
          <p>And I don't blame them, Everyone should use version control for their projects.</p>
          <p>I've mentioned version control, what exactly is version control?</p>

          <p>Version Control is the process of keeping old versions of files for archival or future use.</p>
          <p>Did you just push a feature that broke your app? use version control to go back in time and grestore your app back to a time when it wasn't broken.</p>
          <p>May have heard it called revision control, or source control</p>
          <p>Lets take a short stroll back through time to see the history of version control</p>
          <p>A title that would better describe what I'm about to tell you would be</p>

          <p>Sort by date? Well you just started working here and the person who used to maintain the file left, and you need to find out which one is the right one.</p>

          <p>there's got to be a better way!</p>
          <p>So there were some better version control systems that came out, you may already be familiar with some of them, CVS, SNVN, Mercurial, but along comes this heavyweight contender...</p>

          <p>Creating a repo is really simple using the GitHub for windows client.</p>
          <p>it's literally a drag and drop operation to turn any existing project into a GitHub repo.</p>
          <p>We'll create a new repo from a project we've been working on about Kittens</p>
          <p>After you drag the folder into GHW, you'll get prompted to fill in some information about it &raquo;</p>
          <p>We'll come up with a good name for our repo, we'll call it, Kittens.</p>
          <p>Here you can decide if you want to push it to gitHub immediately or not, I'll say no this time, and show you how to do it in the GUI.</p>
          <p>It's that simple to create a new project on GitHub.</p>

          <p>DMV was developing their Registration Renewal application.</p>
          <p>This was a public site, so of course they they wanted it to be mobile friendly so everyone could use it.</p>
          <p>the best way to make a public site mobile friendly is to develop it using RWD</p>
          <p>They were really pressed for developers so they asked the CTO's office for help.</p>
          <p>we mobilized another swat team to help them out.</p>

        <aside class="notes">
          <p>8 people.. 4 Agencies 4 buildings ..all working on the same project, as time allowed. That 20% time wasnt the same for everyone. We had the flexibility to chime in at any time 24/7, when our schedules allowed, and the team was kept in the loop.</p>
          <p>This was what ITS has been talking about. This was true cross-cluster collaboration</p>
          <p>More importantly though, I think it broke the mold of what NYS previously considered collaboration.</p>
          <p>I want to let you in on a secret. this collaboration would have never occurred if it weren't for a single directective.</p>

          <p>These are the next things you need to know once you get the basics down pat.</p>
          <p>Pull requests are how you request your changes be pulled into another project of branch</p>
          <p>branches are how I do my workflow, but understanding them is a bit more advanced than I wanted to get into today.</p>
          <p>GH pages is a free web hosting platform for your projects built right into github</p>
          <p>and merge conflicts. When dealing with any version control system, you'll encounter merge conflicts sometimes. they suck, but there is always a way to resolve them.</p>
