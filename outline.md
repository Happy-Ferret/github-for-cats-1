# GitHub for Cats Outline

## What is version control?

AKA Revision control, SOurce COntrol

Distributed File system where the files are located at a centralized server but you pull down a local copy and submit patches back to the centralized location with your local modifications

### Brief History of Version COntrol
 - Use list of ever longening File names

## What is Git _(very short)_

distributed Version COntrol system built on an open source platform

Why is it better? http://thkoch2001.github.io/whygitisbetter and http://git-scm.com/about

## Why use VC or Git at all?

 - No checking files in and out to modify them. Editing the same file simultaneously
 - LOng distance collaboration (Guy from UK that enhanced my plugin)
 - Breaks down the silos we've built for years and shares our code with each other and if we choose, the world.
 - Will make us better coders when we know people are watching.
 - History of Every change to ever file
 - Detailed line by line list of who owns each line of every file "blame log"
 - Offline editing (airplane submarine), keeps a lit of all of your revisions until you are ready to commit
 - Fast workflow

## What is GitHub

GitHub centralizes the distributed system

Existence of github means that Git is the best vc system.

Create public and prvate repos, served over https or SSH

GitHub is the new standard. So many people are using it and it has become a requirement for many tech jobs

Adds a social aspect to coding

### Quick overview of the site

 - Browse repos
 - Stars
 - Following people
 - More

## Terminology
 - Repo
 - Branch
 - Clone
 - COmmit
 - Pull (maybe drop in favor of keeping simpler and just do forking)
 - Fork (Metaphor: photocopying, clone)

## Creating your First Repo

Create GH account
Install GitHub GUI (windows and MAc)
Add Username
Copy in existing project
Publish it
Done

## Creating your SEcond Repo

Copy in existing project
Publish it
Done.

## Creating your third repo

Getting the picture?

## GitHub makes VC Easy

Up and running so quickly

## Cloning someone elses repo

GH is social, all code that is made publically available is at your fingertips
Find jQuery
CLone jQuery
Can make changes to it now and use them for yourself
or make a bug fix and send changes back to them to fix it.

## Keeping Track of changes

 - Committing 101
    - MEtaphor: Planting a flag in the ground to say this is what this code was like at this point in time.
    - Have the ability to create new flags, and review flags, and go back to old flags
 - Make a small change in project
 - See the change detailed line by line
 - Commit the changes, and sync back to GH
    - Notice that commits are on the left line by line and code changes are on the right with diffs clearly displayed (Dont use the term Diff as we havent explained that, go with somethign more concrete)

## Other Useful Features

GitHub isn't just for code, you can use it for documents and images as well. replaces that list of 12 versions of the same document with increasingly long file names (Maybe say this earlier so as to not lose the non-coders right from teh beginning)

Mobile GH

Pulse
 - Keep track of progress across the code base (How to represent this? "dashboard?"")

Issues
 - Track bugs
 - Track feature requests
 - Notifications

GitHub Pages
 - Create a branch and see your changes imediately
