_LEAD: Teams that use GitHub unlock their true collaborative potential_

_Question: How can using GitHub benefit me and my team?_

__LESS DETAIL MORE IDEAS__

_Here is how to get started. Never more than 1 half step ahead of beginner._

## GitHub at a Glance

 - GitHub is the new standard. So many people are using it and it has become a requirement for many tech jobs
    - 5.5M developers
    - 16.4M hosted projects
    - Site features a 99.69% uptime.
 - Logo is the Octocat, a cross between a cat and an octopus: http://octodex.github.com/
 - GitHub provides a centralized medium for programmers to share code.
 - Create public and private repos, served over https or SSH (Matrix of pub vs priv)
 - Adds a social aspect to coding

## What is version control?

_"A brief, and vastly incomplete history of Version Control Throughout the ages"_

AKA Revision control, SOurce COntrol

Lets say you need to write your Final Essay for a class.

__Old Version Control for Essay__

_"In the beginning.."_

 - __TERMINOLOGY:__ Repo

 - Start by versioning the name
 - Now you have 20 files and you don't know which is which

__Using Git for the Essay__

_Distributed Version Control system built on an open source platform where the files are located at a centralized server but you pull down a local copy and submit patches back to the centralized location with your local modifications_

 - __TERMINOLOGY:__ Clone, Commit, Pull _(Schema: Photocopying)_

 - Now you keep the same file name but can review old versions of the essay from any point in time
 - 1 file, with a History

__Using GitHub for the Essay__

 - __TERMINOLOGY:__ Fork

 - You distribute it for free online
 - Anyone in the world can improve your essay now
 - They can submit fixes or add additional content to make it utterly amazing.

## Why use GitHub?

 - Built-in Project management Tools
    - Collaboration with permission system
    - Wikis
    - Issue Tracking
    - Code Review
 - Handles large projects with ease
 - No checking files in and out to modify them. Editing the same file simultaneously
 - Long distance collaboration (Guy from UK that enhanced my plugin)
 - History of Every change to every file
 - Offline editing (airplane submarine), keeps a lit of all of your revisions until you are ready to commit
 - Fast workflow
 - GitHub isn't just for code, you can use it for documents and images as well. replaces that list of 12 versions of the same document with increasingly long file names
 - You don’t have to take my word on it: Android, jQuery, etc etc

[Probably drop ITS as a slide]
__ITS official stance on GH__
