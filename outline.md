## Why use VC or Git at all?

 - No checking files in and out to modify them. Editing the same file simultaneously
 - LOng distance collaboration (Guy from UK that enhanced my plugin)
 - Breaks down the silos we've built for years and shares our code with each other and if we choose, the world.
 - Will make us better coders when we know people are watching.
