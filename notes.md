## Here are my notes from May 2013

Basic overview of what version control is. Showing old “version control” an infinitely long list of final1 final 2 etc.

How distributed and hosted version control can bridge the distance gap between contributors and keep a detailed log of each one. Use listnav as an example, with that guy from EU that committed.

Distributed file system where the files are located at a central server but you pull down a local copy and basically submit patches using your modified copies

All files are local. You commit changes locally, everything is local until you commit and sync.

You can edit without an internet connection

Get a diff of file changes easily

Metaphor: commit – planting a flag in the ground to say that this is what this code was like at this point in time. Until you sync its all local

SVN and CVS both had an issue where if you tried to commit a file that someone else already committed it would just tell you no.

Branching created 30 branches off the dev branch that never ended up seeing the light of day because things got broken so badly

Github workflow is so fast. Its totally up to the dev team to figure out the best way to do it. do you feature branch every issue and every bug or do you just simply work off master? How do you handle merge conflicts, who is right and who is wrong

Github isn’t just for code, it can be used for binary files as well, albeit not very well. Firestorm PSD web ahead github podcast

Break into parts? What is git, what is ithub, what is workflow, github issues github for windows

KNIT could be a good metaphor for what you are doing

Merge conflicts could be briefly explained by saying that each line of code is a piece of paper in a stack. Each person takes the paper, photocopies it and then makes modifications to it. when one person puts it back into the stack, the stack is changed, but the next person cant put that other code in there because that was already changed once, and its having a hard time seeing what was changed.
Can you do a pull request using github for windows?
